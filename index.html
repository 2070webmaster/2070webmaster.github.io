          <h3>How it Works?</h3>
          <p>
            The IPL generally takes place in March, April and May of every year and lasts for approximately seven weeks.
            The first step is to form teams which is accomplished by the auction. The auction is done
            so that each franchise representative can make a bid for the players that they want in their team.
            After the selection of teams, the tournament begins where each team plays 14 games, both home and away.
            Cricket stadiums around India are booked in advance for this well-known league to happen.
            The top four teams after the end of the season will enter the semi finals. Out of the four, only those two 
            teams which play the best will go to the finals. Finally, the team that wins the final will take away the hefty 
            prize money. The 2 teams in the finals will play the first game of the IPL season in the following year.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            When India won the Twenty20 World Cup in the year 2007, T20 cricket, a short form of
            cricket in which teams only have one innings of twenty overs each, became extremely popular.
            In the same year the Indian Cricket League or ICL was founded, but it never got recognition 
            by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The BCCI was also not pleased when its committee 
            members started joining the ICL executive board. To stop players from joining the ICL, the BCCI 
            decided to start a new Twenty20 league that would rival the ICL. Businessman and cricket executive, 
            Lalit Modi, was tasked with the formation of the Indian Premier League. It was then launched by the
            board in 2008, and it would soon become the most watched cricket league in the world.

          <h3>Popularity</h3>
          <p>
            The main reason behind the increase in brand value and popularity of the IPL is the audience of India. 
            In India, almost every person is fond of watching cricket. So, day by day many big brands
            and many broadcasting channels are willing to sponsor and stream live IPL matches. Due to
            this team players and team owners get so much money. Nowadays it is said that the Indian 
            Premier League has become one of the most successful leagues all around the world. The place 
            of the Indian Premier League is not only in cricket but in all sports. Another reason is the media
            coverage that the league receives. This league is the only one where the media covers every game.
            For every game, there is all kind of news available ranginf from updates about matches to the
            information about the IPL as a whole.
